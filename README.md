# Microposts

Application which stores posts using a JSON server backend API and displays them in frontend with the functionality to edit and/or delete posts. Programmed in JavaScript ES6 to practice Asynchronous commands and working with APIs using fetch.

This project also uses the Babel Webpack Starter by Brad Traversy; a starter pack to build JavaScript applications using standards from ES2015, ES2016 & ES2017. It uses webpack, Babel and webpack-dev-server to compile and serve. It is fully compatible with Async/Await as it uses the Babel polyfill.
